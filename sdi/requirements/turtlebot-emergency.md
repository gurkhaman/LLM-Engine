# Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Autonomous Turtlebot Navigation
- **Objective**: Enable Turtlebot to navigate autonomously while recognizing and responding to environmental cues.
- **Domain**: Mobility and Autonomous Vehicles

# System Overview
- **System Context**: 
  - Operating Environment: Indoor and Outdoor
  - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Foss
  - Middleware: ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy
  - Key Components:
    - Camera: Captures images and publishes them to `/camera/image_raw`
    - Motion Controller: Receives commands via `/cmd_vel`

# Functional Requirements

## FR-001: Emergency Vehicle Recognition
- **Description**: The Turtlebot must identify emergency vehicles, such as ambulances and fire trucks, in its surroundings.
- **Input**: Video feed from the onboard camera from `/camera/image_raw`.
- **Output**: Identification of emergency vehicles with high accuracy (above 95% confidence)



## FR-002: Path Alteration
- **Description**: Upon recognizing an emergency vehicle, the Turtlebot shall alter its path to clear the way.
- **Input**: Emergency vehicle detection results. 
- **Output**: Real-time motion commands sent to `/cmd_vel` for collision-free path planning.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## NFR-001: Processing Time
- **Description**: The system must process inputs and respond to emergency vehicle detection within 300ms.
- **Remarks**: Efficient processing may involve offloading tasks to external services to address onboard resource constraints.
